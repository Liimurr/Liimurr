ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Liimurr, a gameplay programmer working on KovaaK's 2.0

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in in games that combine user generated content with competitive gameplay. Notably *Kovaaks* and *Osu!*. 
 
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create systems that make user generated content and competitive gameplay possible with Unreal Engine.
