ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Liimurr, a gameplay programmer working on KovaaK's 2.0

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in in games that combine user generated content with competitive gameplay. Notably Kovaaks and Osu!. While other notable games offer good inspiration for user generated content in general like Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft, Garrys Mod, Dota 2, and Halo's Forge map editor, there are some unique requirements for user generated content that is meant to be accepted as competitively viable. 

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create systems that make user generated content and competitive gameplay possible with Unreal Engine.
